### <em>A minimalistic, routine based workout tracker</em>

## Overview
The goal here is to provide a standardized way of logging and viewing workout data. Routines and weight values get predetermined by date and previous values, so all you have to do is show up and go. No keeping track of which exercises you do on which day, or what weight you left off at. All data is stored in DynamoDB for access anywhere. Nice graphs and charts let you track your progress per exercise over time.

## To - Do
- [x] Make it run
- [x] Use server actions to interface with DB
-  Design UI
-  PWA Support
-  Data visualization
-  Handle user selection
-  Handle authenticaion

User management is at the bottom because I'd like to get it working end-to-end for a single user first, then expand to handling multiple.
